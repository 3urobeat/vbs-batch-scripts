A repository containing some of my maybe useful vbs scripts.

Error Script - A batch script that creates a vbs, kills explorer.exe, opens errors and starts itself again until your computer crashes.  
YouTube Wap Bap Script - A script that opens a stupid song every 10 seconds at the refrain even if you close the browser again and again until you find it in the task manager. Good for trolling people with less computer knowledge.
